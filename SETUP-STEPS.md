# iremehub LMS Database Setup Steps

This document outlines the steps taken to ensure the application properly connects to MongoDB and stores all data in the database.

## Steps Completed

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created .env file in the server directory with MongoDB connection string
   - Configured JWT settings and other environment variables
   - Chose local MongoDB for development (can be switched to MongoDB Atlas for production)

2. **Database Connection Testing**
   - Created diagnostic scripts to test database connectivity
   - Successfully connected to local MongoDB instance
   - Verified connection with ping test

3. **Database Seeding**
   - Implemented database seeding script
   - Created sample users (admin, educator, student)
   - Added sample courses and relationships
   - Confirmed data was properly stored in the database

4. **Server Configuration**
   - Updated server to use the database connection
   - Added health check endpoint to verify connectivity
   - Set up proper error handling for database connection issues
   - Created Vercel configuration for production deployment

5. **Verification**
   - Started the server successfully
   - Confirmed API health endpoint shows database is connected
   - Verified data access through API endpoints

## Current Database Stats

Collection counts in the database:
- **users**: 3 documents
- **courses**: 3 documents
- **progresses**: 2 documents
- **certificates**: 0 documents
- **sections**: 0 documents
- **announcements**: 0 documents
- **lessons**: 0 documents
- **payments**: 0 documents

## Access Credentials

Use these credentials to test the application:
- **Admin**: admin@example.com / Admin123!
- **Educator**: educator@example.com / Educator123!
- **Student**: student@example.com / Student123!

## Deployment Ready

The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel with the following considerations:
1. MongoDB Atlas should be used for production
2. Environment variables must be set in Vercel dashboard
3. Proper IP whitelisting must be configured in MongoDB Atlas

## Next Steps

1. Complete frontend-backend integration testing
2. Implement additional data validation
3. Set up regular database backups
4. Monitor database performance in production
