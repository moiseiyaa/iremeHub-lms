# IremeHub LMS - Server

This is the backend server for the IremeHub Learning Management System, now fully converted to TypeScript.

## TypeScript Conversion Complete!

The entire server codebase has been successfully migrated to TypeScript. This provides enhanced type safety, better developer experience, and more robust code.

### Key Improvements:
- All models, controllers, routes, and middleware are now in TypeScript.
- Mongoose models have corresponding TypeScript interfaces.
- Express request/response objects are strongly typed.
- Consistent use of ES6+ modules (`import`/`export`).

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server using `ts-node` with auto-reloading.
- `npm run build`: Compile the TypeScript source code into JavaScript in the `dist` folder.
- `npm start`: Run the compiled JavaScript application.
